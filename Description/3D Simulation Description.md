I'd like to simulate a camera video stream by building a three.js or similar project, model the street and cars and stream that as it would be a camera capture. What do you think? I'm open to any suggestions. Don't write any code though.

Love it—synthetic video is a great way to iterate fast and control edge cases. Here are solid paths (no code):

### Best options (pick one)
- Three.js in browser (fastest to prototype)
  - Render a small street scene; animate cars to park/unpark and “open door”.
  - Capture the canvas as a MediaStream and publish to a local media server (MediaMTX) via WebRTC. Your detector reads the same feed as RTSP.
  - Pros: quick, fully scripted scenarios; easy to tweak. Cons: visuals less realistic.

- Unity or Unreal (more realism)
  - Use built-in physics, traffic packs, and cinematic camera.
  - Stream with RTSP/RTMP/WebRTC plugins (or to MediaMTX). Great for shadows, night/rain, occlusions.
  - Pros: realistic lighting/materials; big asset ecosystem. Cons: heavier setup.

- CARLA simulator (research-grade driving sim)
  - Has cameras/LiDAR sensors, controllable NPC vehicles, and weather/time-of-day.
  - Feed camera directly to your pipeline; also gives perfect ground-truth labels if you need training data.

### Recommended pipeline (keeps your backend unchanged)
- Media server: MediaMTX (ingest WebRTC/RTMP; output RTSP/HLS/WebRTC).
- Producer:
  - If browser-based: Three.js → canvas.captureStream() → WebRTC publish → MediaMTX.
  - If Unity/Unreal: plugin to RTSP/RTMP/WebRTC → MediaMTX.
- Consumer:
  - Your detector subscribes via RTSP (or WebRTC) as if it were a real camera.

### What to model first (to prove value)
- Street + curb / parking lane + lane markings; 6–10 parking slots (polygons).
- 8–15 cars looping with state machine: cruising → park → idle → open door → depart.
- Triggers tied to time/events to feed your “soon/occupied/available” logic.
- Camera at 2–3 heights/angles to test occlusion and perspective.
- Day/night presets; togglable rain or motion blur.

### Why this helps
- Full control of ground-truth events (park/unpark/door-open), lighting, and density.
- Repeatable scenarios for regression tests and model tuning.
- Easy to stress-test multi-camera overlap and calibration.

### Practical next moves
- Decide the track:
  - “Fast prototype” → Three.js + MediaMTX
  - “High realism” → Unity/Unreal + MediaMTX
  - “Research-grade + labels” → CARLA
- I’ll set up:
  - A MediaMTX config (local)
  - A minimal scene with 10 spots, animated cars, and scripted door-open/depart events
  - A one-click script to start producer(s) and your detector reading RTSP

If you tell me which route you want (Three.js, Unity/Unreal, or CARLA), I’ll outline the exact assets, folder layout, and run commands.
